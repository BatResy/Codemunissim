## Our Standards

### 1. **Be Respectful**
   We embrace diversity and the range of experiences and perspectives that each participant brings. Disagreements and differences of opinion are natural in a collaborative environment, but they should be expressed respectfully. Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and consideration.

### 2. **Be Inclusive**
   We are committed to creating a welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences. Discrimination, harassment, or any form of exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.

### 3. **Be Collaborative**
   We foster a spirit of teamwork. Whether you are submitting code, providing feedback, or reporting issues, always approach your interactions with the goal of creating better solutions together. Encourage and help others, especially those who are new to the community.

### 4. **Be Constructive**
   Criticism should always be constructive. If you're giving feedback, focus on how the code can improve and offer suggestions or alternatives. If you're receiving feedback, approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.

### 5. **Be Transparent and Honest**
   We encourage clear and open communication. Always provide honest feedback, credit contributors properly, and ensure that everyone has a fair chance to contribute to discussions.

### 6. **Respect Privacy**
   Respect the privacy of others. Do not share someone else's personal information without consent. If you have access to private information in the context of your work, handle it responsibly.
